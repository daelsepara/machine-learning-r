# Machine Learning in R

This is a repository for R scripts developed during my machine learning studies. Some of the codes here may be adapted and converted into R from their original Matlab implementations. 

## Neural Network ##

- nnet_train (uses gradient descent backpropagation)
- nnet_forward (forward propagation)
- nnet_backprop (backpropagation with optional regularization)
- nnet_predict (multi-class classification)
- nnet_optimize (use optimized minimization algorithms to update weights)
- fmincg (optimized minimization algorithm)

## Support Vector Machines ##

- svmTrain (training using Support Vector Machine procedure)
- svmPredict (binary classification using SVM)
- plotData
- visualizeBoundary (render decision boundary. Only renders two (2) features
- linearKernel (linear Kernel/Cost/Similarity function)
- gaussianKernel (Radial Basis Function, Gaussian similarity function)
